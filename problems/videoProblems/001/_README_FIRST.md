Question type: Speed round

This problem set is mainly for practice recording a video, then watching it yourself to see how you sound and come across. These problems are too small to ask someone else to review you yet.

**Begin recording your video now**

Give yourself 50 minutes to complete this problem set, including reading these instructions.

Treat this like a real interview. You are on a phone screen, or you are typing in front of someone face-to-face. That person wants to hear and see your thought process. Give them evidence of the areas in [the assessment checklist](https://github.com/hackreactor/peripheral-brain/wiki/How-to-assess-interviews).

Even though these are small problems, don't just blow through them silently, clacking away grimly on your keyboard to hack out code.  Talk out loud -- concisely, mindful of time -- and try to demonstrate the areas of assessment...  just briefly, in miniature. E.g., formulate a question about the problem specification, muse aloud about it to show your thinking, then see if the unit tests answer your question. (And if not, send a PR after the interview!)

**Important note** Run the problem set tests by pointing at the problem set directory: `npm test {path to this directory}`

Ok... open the first problem and go, go go :)
